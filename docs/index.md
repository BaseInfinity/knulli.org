# Welcome to the KNULLI Wiki :material-gamepad:

KNULLI is a custom firmware for retro gaming devices (handhelds, bartops, etc.). It's developed as a fork of [Batocera](https://batocera.org). It tries to provide support for devices that fall under at least one of these categories:

* There are no open source kernel and/or u-boot sources available
* There are sources, but the kernel is either not mainline, and/or too old (e.g. devices with a BSP kernel 3.4 like the Egret II Mini)
* There is no GPU support or the gpu is not supported, so framebuffer is the only option
* It's a device that I own and have decided to build a CFW for it

## Features

KNULLI supports devices with GPU (GLES support) and framebuffer only (legacy).

* Emulation Station frontend for GPU based devices
* Simplemenu/Simplermenu+ for framebuffer only devices (also for GPU ones if preferred)
* RetroArch plus multiple libretro cores
* Wireless and Bluetooth support (including audio) when supported by the device
* Support for external USB wireless for those without internal wireless card
* Retroachivements
* Netplay
* Cover art/thumbnail scrapper support
