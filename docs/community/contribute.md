# :material-account-heart: Contribute

KNULLI is an open-source project by a small team of retro-gaming enthusiasts. However, the KNULLI CFW is built upon the work of many people all over the world, who have contributed to the project directly or indirectly. KNULLI contains open-source bits from various sources, most prominently the Batocera project. We also give special thanks to muOS, JelOS, CoreELEC, LibreELEC, and to developers and contributors across the open-source community.

If you want to contribute to the KNULLI project, too, this page will hopefully provide some inspiration.

## We accept pull requests

The easiest way to contribute to an open-source project is by getting your hands dirty and **start coding**. Feel free to fork our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/knulli-cfw)! Add the features you want! Fix any bug you might find! Once you are done, simply create a **pull-request**. It might take some time, but we will **review** your pull-request and hopefully adopt your changes into the KNULLI project!

## Share your knowledge

Another way to get your hands dirty and contribute directly is by adding guides, tutorials, and other useful information to our website. The website is made with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). You can **contribute to the website** directly by forking the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/knulli.org), adding any missing information, and creating a **pull-request**. Feel invited to correct typos, spelling, and grammar! If you feel confident, you may even provide translations! By sharing your knowledge, you will help the KNULLI community grow!

## Join the community

The KNULLI project thrives not only on its developers but also on its community. If you are not into coding, you can still contribute to the project by joining us on [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/HXPS3DAeeB). On our Discord server, you can share ideas, participate in testing new features, and help other users get started or resolve their issues. Many users join our Discord to **ask for help** - but you could always join to **help us provide answers** instead!

## Become a supporter

KNULLI is an open-source project. The source code and any public release of KNULLI will **always be available for free**. You will **never** have to pay to gain access to a public release of KNULLI.

However, by donating to the KNULLI project, you can help us fund our servers and buy the necessary hardware to develop the CFW. Keep in mind: In order to develop KNULLI for the handheld **you** care for, **we** need access to that handheld - and maybe a couple of SD cards, too!

As a KNULLI supporter, you occasionally get access to **early alpha builds** of KNULLI. However, before you join, please understand: This is **not** an "early access program". **Alpha builds** are made for our community to test new features **before** they go public, so that we can identify and resolve bugs and issues **before** a new public release is published. Alpha builds are **prone to error**, alpha builds are **often unstable**. Sometimes, alpha builds can serve as a daily driver, sometimes they have very annoying quirks.

**Do not** become a supporter if you are driven by the expectation to get early access to stable releases and a ton of new features - you **will** be disappointed. That being said, if you are enthusiastic about KNULLI and want to help testing out new features before they go public, **we will happily accept your donation**!

To become a supporter, please follow these exact steps **in the given order** before you do anything rash:

* create a Discord account (if you do not have one already)
* create a Ko-Fi account (if you do not have one already)
* link your Ko-Fi account to your Discord account (if your accounts are not linked already)
* join us on [:simple-discord: Discord](https://discord.gg/HXPS3DAeeB)
* [buy acmeplus a coffee at Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/acmeplus/)

Thank you for contributing and welcome to KNULLI!
