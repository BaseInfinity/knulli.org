# :material-console: SSH

As an advanced user, you might want to access the command line (or shell) of your KNULLI device to enter Linux commands directly. You may do so by connecting to KNULLI via SSH. There are several SSH clients available. For Windows users, we recommmend [SmarTTY](https://sysprogs.com/SmarTTY) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org).

To connect to your KNULLI device via SSH, simply connect the device to your local network as described in the [Networking](../networking) section.

When establishing your SSH connection, you will need the following information:

* Host: Either the hostname of your KNULLI device or the current IP address (press ++"Start"++ and go to *Network settings* to find your current IP address)
* Username: `root`
* Password: Your current root password (press ++"Start"++ and go to *System settings* and *Security* to find your current root password)
