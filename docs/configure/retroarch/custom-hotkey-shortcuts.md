# :material-controller: Custom Hotkey Shortcuts

!!! danger "Please read before getting started"

    The KNULLI team does **not** recommend to customize RetroArch hotkey shortcuts unless you are **absolutely sure** what you are doing. We **strongly** recommend to get familiar with the **global** [Hotkey Shortcuts](../../../play/hotkey-shortcuts) instead.
    
    Before you attempt to manually reassign your hotkey shortcuts in **RetroArch**, please be aware of two issues:

    * KNULLI comes with **a lot** of emulators which are **not** integrated with RetroArch. Your RetroArch settings will **not apply** to any **standalone emulators**. By changing your RetroArch shortcuts, you will put your device in an **inconsistent state** with **different shortcuts** for different emulators.
    * Some hotkey shortcut actions are implemented on the **operating system level**, not on the emulation level. Consequently, those hotkey shortcuts **cannot be disabled or modified** within RetroArch. Assigning any emulation-level action to a shortcut which is also assigned to an OS-level action will **inevitably** result in a **double binding**.
