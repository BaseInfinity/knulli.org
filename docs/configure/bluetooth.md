# :material-bluetooth: Bluetooth

KNULLI supports a lot of different types of Bluetooth devices, such as input devices (controllers, mice, keyboards, etc.) and audio speakers and headphones.

## Connect a Bluetooth device

!!! info "Troubleshooting"

    If your KNULLI device fails to pair with one of your Bluetooth devices, try **disabling Wi-Fi** while **pairing**. (You can enable Wi-Fi again after pairing.)

    Also, please be aware that some Bluetooth controllers might be built to **only** support the system they are made for, e.g., Android or Nintendo Switch. If your Bluetooth controller does not work with your KNULLI device, make sure that it supports Bluetooth for **PC**.

To connect a Bluetooth device with your KNULLI device, you first need to make sure that both devices support Bluetooth. If so, press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu and go to *Controller & Bluetooth Settings*. Here, you will be able to *Enable Bluetooth* if it is not enabled, yet.

Once Bluetooth is enabled, either try to *Pair Bluetooth Pads Automatically* (to automatically pair input-devices in pairing mode) or select *Pair A Bluetooth Device Manually* and find your device in a list of available Bluetooth devices in your vicinity. If your Bluetooth device does not show up or pairing does not work as expected, check the manual of your Bluetooth device for pairing instructions.

### Assigning controllers

After your devices have been paired successfully, you might need to take additional steps in order to use them. For example, after connecting a Bluetooth controller, you will have to **assign** the controller to a **player** as explained in the [Controls](../controls) section.

### Set up audio output

After pairing an audio output device (like a headphone), you need to set it as your audio output. Press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu, head to *System Settings* and choose your Bluetooth device as *Audio output*.

## Forget a Bluetooth device

If you want to remove or "forget" a paired Bluetooth device, press the ++"Start"++ button to bring up the main menu, head to *Controller & Bluetooth Settings*, open *Forget A Bluetooth Device*, find the device and remove it.
