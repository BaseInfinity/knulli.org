# :material-folder-music-outline: Background Music

Your [userdata folder](../../../play/add-games/game-storage) contains a folder called `music`. If you store any compatible music files in this folder, the music will **replace** the original background music that comes with KNULLI. Instead of the built-in background music, KNULLI will now play the songs from your `music` folder while you are browsing your games in EmulationStation.

!!! info "Make sure your music files are compatible"

    Background music for KNULLI/EmulationStation should be in `MP3` or `OGG` format and have a sample rate of 44100Hz and a bitrate of 256kb/s max.

When adding your background music, you can either dump all your songs randomly into the `music` folder or create subfolders for each **system** if you want to add **system-specific music** for all the systems you like to play. If you want to add your music per system, you should **not** leave any music files in the top level of the `music` folder but sort all your music **by system**. The system names in the `music` folder correspond to the system names in the `roms` folder (e.g., `snes` for SNES, `megadrive` for Mega Drive/Genesis).

Once you added your music, press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu and head to *Sound Settings*. Here you can toggle *Frontend music* on and off. Additionally, you can set up volume, title display duration, and you can also set up whether you want your music selection to be played per system or not.
