# :material-battery-medium: Power Management

Since KNULLI Firefly, the CFW comes with a *Power Management* menu, where you can adjust settings to save some battery life. To reach the 
*Power Management* menu, press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu, head to *System Settings*, then *Power Management*.

## Battery Saving Modes

KNULLI comes with 3 different battery saving modes: *Dim* dims the screen to lower its battery consumption, *Suspend* puts the device in sleep mode, and *Shutdown* shuts the device down gracefully.

The selected battery saving mode will kick in once the user has been idle for a given amount of time which can be set up via *Idle Time*. You will be able to set up values between 1 and 60 minutes.
