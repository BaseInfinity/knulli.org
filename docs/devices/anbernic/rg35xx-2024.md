## Extracting the kernel and bootloader

!!! warning "The RG35XX 2024 distribution includes a bootloader, u-boot, and kernel in binary form extracted from the stock firmware. There are no public sources provided by anbernic for those"

Anbernic has not published the source code of the u-boot and kernel of the RG35xx Plus. In order to have a working configuration you have two options:

* You can use the stock kernel, bootloader, and u-boot from the stock SDCARD. See below for instructions on how to extract those. 
* You can compile the included kernel with the source code of this distribution, however, note that there will be a few elements that are missing

The firwmare included in releases uses the kernel, bootloader, and u-boot from the stock firmware.

You can read [this page](../../guides/h700-firmware-extract.md) to learn how to extract the bootloader, u-boot, and kernel from the stock firmware.
