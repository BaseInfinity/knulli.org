# :material-folder-cog: Formatting

!!! warning "Before reformatting the SD card to exFAT, please be aware that you may not be able to run certain games from the [PortMaster](../../systems/portmaster) library afterwards. Some ports rely on symlinks and large swap files which are not supported by the exFAT file system."

It is possible to reformat the *SHARE* partition to exFAT, to make the partition accessible on Windows. To format the partition to exFAT anyway, open the KNULLI main menu by pressing ++"Start"++ and choose *Format a disk* in the *Frontent developer options* section of the *System settings*. You will be able to choose whether you want your partition formatted to ext4 or exFAT.
