# :material-folder-cog: Formatting

!!! danger "Important:  Read this before you proceed!"

    We **strongly** suggest to use [**Network Transfer**](../network-transfer) to access to your KNULLI device and stick with the **ext4** file system. Before you attempt to format any of your SD cards, please make sure to read the warning in the [Add Games](..) section.

It is possible to reformat the *SHARE* partition to exFAT, to make the partition accessible on Windows. To format the partition to exFAT anyway, open the KNULLI main menu by pressing ++"Start"++ and choose *Format a disk* in the *Frontent developer options* section of the *System settings*. You will be able to choose whether you want your partition formatted to ext4 or exFAT.
